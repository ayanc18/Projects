issues:
1. doNotRandomaize to stay in the front-end? [Not required]
2. inclusion of option_id ,
3. judging/tracking record of question using id.
4. how to take the attempted option in the json format? 
5. Defining a new result-set having the attempted option and id to be sent to the server side.
6. where to place the correct option for each question? server/client
	[sending the {id: "", attemptedOption: ""} pair to the server, server to send back the {id:"", correctOption:"", attemptedOption:"", score:""  sequence: [ {option_id: "", index: ""}, {option_id: "", index: ""}]} object]
7. where to calculate the score? server/client
	[score to be calculated on client side preferably]
8. final json sent back to client on submit format:
		{	
			id:"1",
			correctOption:	"B",
			attemptedOption:"C",
			score:"0"
			sequence: [ 
						//{option_id: "A", prev_option_id: "D"}, {option_id: "", index: ""}
					]
		}
